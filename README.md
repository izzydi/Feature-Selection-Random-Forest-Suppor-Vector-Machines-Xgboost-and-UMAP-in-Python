# Feature-Selection-Random-Forest-Suppor-Vector-Machines-Xgboost-and-UMAP-in-Python

This project focuses on feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques applied to a classification problem in Python. 
I used several popular algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Xgboost for feature selection, 
followed by dimensionality reduction using UMAP.

The use of UMAP for dimensionality reduction is particularly interesting, as it is a relatively new algorithm that has shown promising results in various applications.
I provided visualizations of the reduced feature space using UMAP, which can help in gaining insights into the data.

Overall, this project provides a useful demonstration of the practical application of feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques in Python 
for classification problems.
